# Cloud Masking with Google Earth Engine API

## Introduction
This project provides a tool for generating cloud masks using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) API and Python. The tool is designed to process satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2, and generate cloud masks to identify and exclude cloudy pixels. This is particularly useful for researchers and analysts working with remote sensing data to improve the accuracy of environmental and land use studies.

## Features
- **Cloud Detection**: Utilizes the GEE API to detect clouds in satellite imagery.
- **Mask Generation**: Generates cloud masks to filter out cloudy pixels.
- **Integration with Google Earth Engine**: Leverages GEE for efficient and scalable processing.
- **Export Options**: Supports exporting cloud masks in various formats.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `earthengine-api`
  - `numpy`
  - `geemap`
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks (optional, for interactive analysis)
